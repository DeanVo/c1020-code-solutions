User can sign up
  User will be able to register an account by sending a request to the server from the client side.
  Assuming there are no issues and the request goes through, server will take this information
  and send it to the database to be stored. Once submitted, the data will be queried to the database where the username is
  saved in a table and the password is hashed. This data is saved for future use.


User can sign in
  User can only access features of this app when they have an account. Once the user is registered, they will be able to login with
  the account they created earlier. Client side will make requests to the server to validate that this is a registered account from the
  database. If the password matches the hashed password then the user is allowed to access the main app features.

  The app decides what screen to show based on the state of the route. Depending on the React element clicked, the route state will change to
  render the corresponding page.


User can stay signed in
  On login, a token is created from the server and goes through a verification process. Once the server confirms with the database that
  this is a valid account, the server will issue the account a token that is digitally signed. This serves as a way to authenticate
  that the user is who they say they are and allow the user to stay signed in even when navigating away from the page.

  The user stays logged in because once they are signed in, their user data is stored in the user state. They will not log out until the user state
  is cleared, or by clicking the Sign Out button or clearing the cache.
